# Improved-Mechanical-Joint-Design
This project showcases an improved version of a mechanical joint.
The goal is to enhance its structural strength and durability while maintaining the original dimensional requirements.

## Key Dimensions
Base diameter: 45 mm

Arm height: 55 mm

Distance between arms: 54 mm

Arm thickness: 5 mm

Base thickness: 5 mm

Side hole diameter: 5 mm

Four holes at the base for mounting

## Design Features
- Fillets added at connection areas to reduce stress concentration

- Symmetric layout for better load distribution

- Clean and simplified geometry to support fabrication and simulation

## Files Included
- STL and STEP files for manufacturing or simulation
- This README file
